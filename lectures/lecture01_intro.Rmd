## What is R?

"R" is shorthand for ["GNU R"](https://www.r-project.org):

- An interactive programming language
- Focus on data analysis ("stats") and plotting
- "R" is also shorthand for the ecosystem around this language
    
    - Book authors
    - Package developers
    - Ordinary useRs
  
Learning to use R will make you **more efficient** and **facilitate the use** of advanced data analysis tools

## Why use R?

- It's *free!*
- easy to install / maintain
- easy to process big files and analyse huge amounts of data
- integrated data visualisation tools, *even dynamic*
- fast, and even faster with *C++* integration via [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-attributes.pdf).
- easy to get help – [huge R community in the web](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R)
    + [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) with a lot of tags like **dplyr**, **ggplot2** etc.
    + [rbloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com)
    + [`#rstats`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) on twitter

## Help

2 possibilities
```{r}
?log
help(log)
```

In **Rstudio**, the help page can be viewed in the bottom right pane

```{r}
apropos("log")
```

## Drawback: Steep learning curve | Period of much suckiness

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/vembedr")
library("vembedr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))
embed_youtube("8SGif63VW6E", query = list(start = secs("4m12s"), end = secs("4m52s")))
# use_start_time() exists but no way to setup a stop time with a helper function?
```

## Tidyverse

**R base** is complex, [**tidyverse**](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse) is better.

[Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz) is a chief scientist at **Rstudio** and a developer that creates and maintains the fundamental packages from the _tidyverse_ such as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")  # awesome plotting by layers
library("tidyr")    # shape data correct
library("readr")    # alternative to read.table
library("dplyr")    # apply made easy
library("magrittr") # pipe for R
```

# RStudio

![](img/01_logo_RStudio.png)

## Rstudio | What is it?

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is an Integrated Development Environment.  
It makes working with R much easier

### Features

>- _Console_ to run **R**, with syntax highlighter
>- _Editor_ to work with scripts
>- _Package management_ (including building)
>- _autocompletion_ using <kbd>TAB</kbd>
>- Cheatsheets
>- Keyboard shortcuts

Don't mix up **R** and **RStudio**.  
**R** needs to be installed first.

## Rstudio | The 4 panels layout

![](img/01_rstudio_layout.jpg)

## Getting started

Let's get ready to use **R** and **RStudio**. Do the following:

- Open up RStudio
- Maximise the RStudio window
- Click the Console pane, at the prompt (`>`) type in `3 + 2` and hit enter

```{r, eval = FALSE, prompt = TRUE}
3 + 2
```

## Arithmetic operations

You will not be surprised that **R** is very good at sums. It has all the arithmetic operators you would expect to see:

- `+`: addition  
- `-`: subtraction  
- `*`: multiplication  
- `/`: division  
- `^`: exponentiation 
- `%%`: modulo
- `%/%`: integer division

**Remember** that **R** will:

- first perform **exponentiation**
- then multiplications and/or divisions
- and finally additions and/or subtractions.

If you need to change the priority during the evaluation, use parentheses – _i.e._ `(` and `)` – to group calculations.

## Rstudio | Working directory and projects

### Working directory

It is where **R** is looking for files (read or write).  
Using the console, try:

```{r, prompt = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

- It is possible to change the location using `setwd()` (in the console or interactively in _RStudio_)
- A better way is to use projects in Rstudio

### Projects

They solve most issues with working directories: get rid of `setwd()`

# Data types and structures

## 4 main types

Type          | Example
------------- | ---------------------------
numeric       | integer (2), double (2.34)
string        | "biostat !"
boolean       | TRUE / FALSE
complex       | 2+0i

### Special case

```{r, eval = FALSE}
NA   # not available, missing data
NULL # empty
```

## Structures

>- Vectors
>- Factors
>- Matrix (2n), Arrays (3+n)
>- Lists
>- Data frames


## Data types 2

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# evaluate
typeof(2)
# check
is.integer(2.34)
# convert
as.integer(2.34)
```

## Vectors

**Vectors** are the simplest type of "object" in R.
```{r}
print(5)
```

**[1]** means we made a numeric vector of length 1.
Now look at what the **`:`** operator does:

```{r}
1:30
```

How many elements are in the thing we made here? What does the **[24]** signify?

<!-- ---- splitting does not work with smaller: true -->
##

Think of vectors as collections of simple things (like numbers) that are ordered. We can create vectors from other vectors using the **`c`** function:

```{r}
c(2, TRUE, "a string")
```

We can use the assignment operator to associate a name to our vectors in order to reuse them:
```{r}
myvec <- c(3, 4, 1:3)
myvec
```

##

The following will build a character vector. We know this because the elements are all in quotes.

```{r}
char.vec <- c("dog", "cat", "ape")
```

Now use the **`c`** function to combine a length-one vector number of the number `4` with the `char.vec`. What happens?

```{r}
c(4, char.vec)
```

Notice that the 4 is quoted. R turned it into a character vector and then combined it with char.vec.   All the elements in a vector must be of the same type.

##

R has a few built in vectors. One of these is `LETTERS`. What does it contain?

```{r}
LETTERS
```

How do extract the first element from this (the letter A). Here is how to do it:

```{r}
LETTERS[1]
```

Use the square brakets to subset vectors

##

What do we do if we need more than one element? Here is how to get elements in position 3 through to 10:

```{r}
LETTERS[3:10]
```

Remember what the : operator does? Take a look:

```{r}
3:10
```

Can you see how `LETTERS[3:10]` works now?

##

Exercise

- find a way to output the following
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[2:5]
```

- find a way to output the following
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(2:5, 7)]
```

- find a way to output first 5 letters + one to the last
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(1:5, length(LETTERS) - 1)]
```


##

Solution

```{r, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS[2:5]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(2:5, 7)]
```
```{r, eval = TRUE}
LETTERS[c(1:5, length(LETTERS) - 1)]
```

## Vectorized operation

```{r}
myvec <- 10:20
myvec + 2
```

```{r}
myvec * c(1:3)
```

Mind that **R** recycles when vectors are too short

## Factors

Vectors with qualitative data

```{r}
factor(c("cytoplasm", "nucleus", "extracellular", "nucleus", "nucleus"))
```

## Matrix

```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)
M
```
```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
M
```

## Array

```{r}
A <- array(1:12, dim = c(1, 4, 3))
A
```

## Lists

Most permissive type. Could be anything!
```{r}
list(name = "Farina", firstname = "Geoff", year = 1995)
```

## Data frame

Most important type to recall. `ggplot2` and `dplyr` focus on those.

```{r}
women
```

##

The function `as.data.frame()` allows to convert a matrix / list into a `data.frame`.  
A data frale can be considered as a collection of vectors having the **same length**.

We can extract a vector from a data frame in a few different ways:

```{r}
# Using the name and the $ operator
women$height
# using [[]], name in quotes or indices
women[["height"]]
```

##

Could be used as a table, specify a cell by `row`, `column`

```{r}
head(women, 5)
women[4, 2]
```

## Reading data | 1/3

Independent from `Rstudio`.

Simulate a file by writing down `women` data

```{r}
write.table(women, file = "women.tsv", sep = "\t", row.name = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Loading it

```{r}
df <- read.table("women.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
head(df, 3)
```

## Hadley's version

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readr", dep = TRUE, repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

```{r}
library("readr")
df <- read_tsv("women.tsv", col_names = TRUE)
df
```

## Reading data | 2/3

Using `Rstudio`, right bottom panel. Select the **folder**

![](img/rstudio_explorer.png)

## Reading data | 2/3

When the **folder** is selected and its content displayed, tell `R` to use this location (alternative to `setwd(/path/to/location)`). Press the `More` menu and click on

`Set As Working Directory`

![](img/rstudio_setwd.png)


## Reading data | 3/3

Using `Rstudio`, right top panel. Select directly your **file**

![](img/rstudio_import.png)

## Style

`R` is rather flexible and permissive with its syntax. However, being more strict tends to ease the debugging process.

See [Hadley's recommendations](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

Basically
- use **spaces**
- use more **lines**
    - `}` alone on their line except for
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    } else {
    ```
    - using the pipe `%>%` for one instruction per line
    - break list definition, function arguments ...
