## Introduction

- Give students and introduction to the programming language for statistical computations - R
- Bridge previously obtained theoretical knowledge in the field of Statistics
with practical applications to biological data
- Provide strong practical skills in the analysis of large-scale data sets with R

### Tidyverse

Replace _R_ base functions by the [tidyverse](tidyverse) which is now an official [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse). 
Adopt [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) philosophy, take each step of data science and simplify the tools. 
Keeping what make them helpful and removing inconsistent and historic behaviors.

## Description

The course will be structured around computer practical's and will cover the following issues :

- Introduction to programming
    + basic concepts of algorithm building
    + R language
    + functional programming
- Descriptive statistics with R
    + variance, mean, median and ditribution descriptors
    + Central Tendency
- Hypotheses testing
    + concepts of _p-value_ and confidence intervals
    + correction for multiple testing
    + one sample
    + two samples
- Correlation
    + parametric
    + non-parametric tests
- Regression models
    + linear models, least squares method
    + generalized linear model (GLMs)
    + non linear models
    + multiple regression
- Analysis of variance, ANOVA
    + one-way
    + two-ways
- Count data
    + contingency tables
    
## Learning Outcomes

Students' ability to apply statistical methods to analyze the real-life data,
including advance statistical tests.

Beyond biostatistics _per se_, the final aim is to provide a methodology and framework to work as 
a **data scientist**. This encompasses everything from importing raw data to final communication
as described below by Hadley Wickham in his must-read book [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
