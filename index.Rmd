## Introduction

- Give students and introduction to the programming language for statistical computations - R
- Bridge previously obtained theoretical knowledge in the field of Statistics
with practical applications to biological data
- Provide strong practical skills in the analysis of large-scale data sets with R

### Tidyverse

Replace _R_ base functions by the [tidyverse](tidyverse) which is now an official [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse). 
Adopt [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) philosophy, take each step of data science and simplify the tools. 
Keeping what make them helpful and removing inconsistent and historic behaviors.
