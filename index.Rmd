## Introduction

- Give students and introduction to the programming language for statistical computations - [_R_](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Bridge previously obtained theoretical knowledge in the field of Statistics
with practical applications to biological data
- Provide strong practical skills in the analysis of large-scale data sets with _R_

### Tidyverse

Replace _R_ base functions by the [tidyverse](tidyverse) which is now an official [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse). 
Adopt [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) philosophy, take each step of data science and simplify the tools. 
Keeping what make them helpful and removing inconsistent and historic behaviors.
His proposed workflow is described as follow in his must-read book [_R_ for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## Description

The course will be structured around computer practical's and will cover the following issues :

- Introduction to programming
    + basic concepts of algorithm building
    + _R_ language
    + functional programming
- Descriptive statistics with R
    + variance, mean, median and ditribution descriptors
    + Central Tendency
- Hypotheses testing
    + concepts of _p-value_ and confidence intervals
    + correction for multiple testing
    + one sample
    + two samples
- Correlation
    + parametric
    + non-parametric tests
- Regression models
    + linear models, least squares method
    + generalized linear model (GLMs)
    + non linear models
    + multiple regression
- Analysis of variance, ANOVA
    + one-way
    + two-ways
- Count data
    + contingency tables
    
## Learning Outcomes

Students' ability to apply statistical methods to analyze the real-life data,
including advance statistical tests.

Beyond biostatistics _per se_, the final aim is to provide a methodology and framework to work as 
a **data scientist**. This encompasses everything from importing raw data to final communication
as described by Hadley Wickham. In terms of _R_ packages, the workflow is nicely depicted as in this
picture, by [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/)
